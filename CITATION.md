## How to Cite in Your Paper

When using Decision Jungles in your research, we recommend citing both the software implementation and the original paper. For example:

> In our experiments, we used the scikit-learn compatible implementation of Decision Jungles (Decision Jungle Team, 2024), which is based on the algorithm described in Shotton et al. (2013).
